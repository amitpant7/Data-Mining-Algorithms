# Data Mining Projects
Listing of projects I completed related to data mining as part of the Data Mining course, with links to the implementation repositories. Each project includes a notebook with the complete algorithm implementation, covering exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation. Additionally, each project is accompanied by a paper in IEEE format, with description of all aspects.

## 1. Principal Component Analysis üåæ
**Project:** Insights in Wheat Seed and Irish Flower Data Through PCA  

Analysis implementing PCA for dimensionality reduction on wheat seed and iris flower datasets. The project demonstrates effective feature extraction and visualization of high-dimensional agricultural data.
